For this project, we developed a model that recommends music to add to a playlist, given the previously added songs. Every listener has the constant challenge of finding the pieces that best suit their preferences or the mood of their playlists due to the sheer volume and accessibility of modern music platforms. Thus, to understand how these platforms present their recommendations, we created a few models to offer users customized recommendations.
